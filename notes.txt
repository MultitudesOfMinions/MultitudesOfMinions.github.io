Plan! This document will note the current plan/outline basic functionality and framework.

Path/Misc:
-Dynamically generate path
-Camera will pan to keep up max distance reached
-Towers will generate various distances form the path but within range of the tower
-Tower level will increase as distance increases
-Tower will attack minion furthest along path within range
-Minion spawn rate will decrease as distance increases
-Minions spawn location will increase as max distance reached increases

Minion:
-Name/Type
-HP
-Damage
-Attack speed (time between attacks)
-Range (store range squared to make calculations faster)
-Spawn rate
-Move speed
-Location (x,y)
-isFlying

Tower Builder:(pass in type, level, and location; tower instance will be created)
-Name/Type
-Base HP
-Base Damage
-Base Attack speed (time between attacks)
-Base Range (store range squared to make calculations faster)
-Base Chain Count
-Base Chain Range (store range squared to make calculations faster)
-Base Chain Damage Multiplier (damage on next target = target damage * chain damage multiplier)
-Base Splash Radius (store radius squared to make calculations faster)
-Can hit air (bit)
-Can hit ground (bit)
-HP multiplier (used to calculate higher level towers)
-Damage multiplier (used to calculate higher level towers)
-Attack speed multiplier (used to calculate higher level towers)
-Range multiplier (used to calculate higher level towers)
-Chain Count multiplier (used to calculate higher level towers)
-Chain range multiplier (used to calculate higher level towers)
-Chain damage multiplier multiplier (used to calculate higher level towers)
-Splash radius multiplier (used to calculate higher level towers)

Tower:
-Name/Type
-HP
-Damage
-Attack speed (time between attacks)
-Range (store range squared to make calculations faster)
-Location (x.y)
-Chain Count
-Chain Range (store range squared to make calculations faster)
-Chain Damage Multiplier (damage on next target = target damage * chain damage multiplier)
-Splash Radius (store radius squared to make calculations faster)
-Can hit air (bit)
-Can hit ground (bit)
