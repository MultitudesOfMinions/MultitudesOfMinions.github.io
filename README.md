About: 
You control minions (initially just 1) and battle your way through endless defensive towers. You can upgrade your minions, unlock different types of minions, and other misc upgrades.

I wanted to make an idle/incremental game from scratch/without any libraries. It is an ongoing project I work on when life lets me.

Future state I am planning on adding heroes (assist towers), bosses (assist minions), and adding equipment (passive bonuses).

Tasks:
<ol>
 <li>Heroes - spawn at tower cluster (defend/assist towers & custom effects)</li>
 <li>bosses (attack/assist minions)</li>
 <li>make a favicon</li>
 <li>balance costs</li>
 <li>toggle minion production</li>
 <li>work on art</li>
 <li>Make more tasks</li>
</ol>

Future releases:
<ul>
 <li>equipment (boost minions/choose equips/minion type)</li>
</ul>
