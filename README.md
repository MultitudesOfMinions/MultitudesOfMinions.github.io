About:
You control minions (initially just 1) and battle your way through endless defensive towers and heroes. You can upgrade your minions, unlock different types of minions, and other misc upgrades.

I wanted to make an idle/incremental tower offense game from scratch/without any libraries just using notepad++. It is an ongoing project I work on when [lw]ife lets me.
